Plan for 06-06-2018

Which jobs are most crucial?
The most crucial job right now is to ensure the basic functionality of the game. This includes the ability to click on objects to cook/serve them, the ability of the customer and the player to make orders, and having the player earn money.

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
Core functionality: 
- have a functional game that responds to customerâ€™s orders and serve customers based on their priority
- have customers appear on the screen (done) and show their orders (not done)
- clicking and timing (explained more in depth later) 
- tipping
Non-essentials: aesthetics 
	- trash can
	- animation of customers arriving/leaving
	- would like a start screen, which when clicked, would go to the actual game
	- tutorial to teach player the game
	- comments given by the customer
	- different characteristics of special customers ( Gordon Ramsay, Julia Child, Guy Fieri, Bobby Flay, Martha Stewart, Rachel Ray, troll ) 
	- having an animated countdown timer

Which components are prerequisites for others?
- priority of customers, where special customers are able to go in the front of the	line
- making sure different Java objects like food and kitchen equipment show up as distinct objects on the play screen (food is done) 
- ability of customers to make orders, and for the player to be able to make the order and compare the two
- clicking functionality ( selecting the customer to view their order // clicking on food and stove to cook it // creating the final order and giving it to the customer )
- timing functionality ( for cooking food // burning food // customers leaving if order takes too long )
- tipping functionality ( so that the user can earn money to purchase upgrades )
- that there is a distinct 
	win condition ( earning a certain amount of money ) &
	lose condition ( having too many customers leave the store )
- clicking on store button brings player to a different store screen, and buttons for purchases works as intended

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
Collaboratively tackled:
	- making sure chunks work cohesively
	- fixing bugs
Delegated:
    	- completing chunks of the game ( one is responsible for the store, the other is responsible for the customer, and the last person is responsible for the food )


What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
[x] 5 / 30 / 2018: worked on the UML diagram, not completed
[x] 5 / 31 / 2018: decide whether we are working on Processing or Java first; finish 	making UML; start on flow charts
[x] 6 / 1 / 2018: finish flow charts 
[~] 6 / 2 / 2018 - 6 / 3 / 2018: complete the chunks
[~] 6 / 4 / 2018 - 6 / 5 / 2018: put the chunks together by testing them on the Driver
[~] 6 / 6 / 2018: complete the chunks, put the chunks together by testing them on the Driver
[] 6 / 7 / 2018: add in GUI if possible; product testing and bug fixing.
[] 6 / 8 / 2018: demos! :)
